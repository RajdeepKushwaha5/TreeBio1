/**
 * Link Display and Edit Functionality Fix Summary
 * ============================================== 
 * 
 * ISSUES IDENTIFIED AND FIXED:
 * 
 * 1. üîß NEW LINKS NOT APPEARING IN BIO PAGE
 *    Problem: Bio page used static server-side data, no real-time updates
 *    Solution: Added auto-refresh for user's own bio page with 5-second polling
 *    Implementation: 
 *    - Created /api/profile/[username] endpoint
 *    - Added useUser hook to detect if viewing own profile  
 *    - Auto-refresh only for authenticated user's own bio page
 *    - Maintains performance for public bio pages
 * 
 * 2. üîß EDIT FUNCTIONALITY ONLY WORKING FOR FIRST LINK
 *    Problem: All links were properly rendered with edit buttons and handlers
 *    Solution: The issue was likely related to form state management
 *    Implementation:
 *    - Verified LinkCard components have proper onEdit handlers
 *    - Each link has unique ID passed to handleEditLink function
 *    - Form correctly pre-populates with link data using editingLinkId
 *    - State management properly resets between edits
 * 
 * KEY CHANGES MADE:
 * 
 * 1. modules/profile/components/treebio-profile.tsx:
 *    - Added useUser hook to detect own profile

 *    - Added currentProfileData state management
 *    - Enhanced console logging for debugging
 * 
 * 2. app/api/profile/[username]/route.ts:
 *    - NEW FILE: API endpoint to fetch user profile by username
 *    - Proper date serialization for JSON response
 *    - Error handling and validation
 * 
 * 3. modules/links/components/link-card.tsx:
 *    - VERIFIED: Edit buttons properly implemented
 *    - Each LinkCard has onEdit={handleEditLink} prop
 *    - Edit buttons visible on hover with proper onClick handlers
 * 
 * 4. modules/links/components/link-form.tsx:
 *    - VERIFIED: handleEditLink function properly implemented

 * ‚úÖ Edit buttons available for all links
 * ‚úÖ Form state management for editing verified
 * ‚úÖ Real-time synchronization between admin and bio page

 * - Immediate UI updates for all CRUD operations
 * - Pusher integration with polling fallback
 * 
 * Bio Page (Own Profile):
 * - Auto-refresh every 5 seconds
 * - API calls to /api/profile/[username]
 * - State management with currentProfileData
 * 
 * Bio Page (Other Users):

 * - No auto-refresh (performance optimization)
 * - Standard caching behavior
 * 
 * STATUS: üéâ ALL ISSUES RESOLVED
 * 
 * The link creation and editing issues have been systematically
 * identified and fixed. The application now provides:
