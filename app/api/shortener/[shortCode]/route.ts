// This file has been removed to fix shortener conflicts.
// Redirects are now handled exclusively by /s/[shortCode]/page.tsx
// This prevents duplication and ensures proper URL handling.
//
// If you need this functionality, use:
// - GET /s/[shortCode] for redirects (handled by page.tsx)
// - POST /api/shortener for creating short URLs
// - GET /api/shortener/[shortCode]/stats for analytics
